Using - Reactjs, Javascript, MDB, React.js Boilerplate, HTML, SCSS

# What I have used in this assignment?
I have used React-Boilerplate, MDB(Material Design for Bootstrap), The Movie Database API, localStorage for saving data.

# How to start the app?
Firstly unzip the zip file and then go to inside the folder ‘MovieDB-UI’ using cd MovieDB-UI/
Install the node modules by -  npm install
Run the app using - npm start
Open your browser and type http://localhost:3000/ and press enter.

# Functionality which I have completed and How to play with App.
After typing http://localhost:3000/ in the browser you will see the login page. You can log in by any email id and any password as you wish.

After login you will be redirected in Movie Dashboard, Where you will see one Header with two Navlinks (Home, My Watch List), Filter and search criteria, 3 tabs (Recently Released(selected by default), Top Rated and View More ).
By using Filter and search criteria.

Please select a value from the dropdown by which you want to search the movie then enter the movie name in the search field.
You can switch the tabs as you wish, By clicking on Top Rated you will see 10 top-rated movies, By clicking on Recently Releasedyou will see 10 recently released movies, By clicking on View more you will be redirected in a new route.

You can add any movie as you wish in your ‘My Watch List’ by clicking on ‘Add to Watch List’ Button from Recently Released, Top Rated or View More.

You can see your Watch List by clicking on the ‘My Watch List’ link in the header. You can remove any movie from your ‘My Watch List’ by clicking on the ‘Remove From Watch List’ button and come back home using Back Arrow Link.

View More - I have implemented Infinite scrolling and ‘Load More Movies’ by Button in View More. You can see total loaded movies as well in View More.

You can Log out your account by clicking on the log out button in the header. If you log in again by the same Email Id you will see your data is saved in ‘My Watch List’. 

If you use another Email Id, then App will behave like another user.

You can do many more login as you wish by using different Email ID, Your Watch List data will be saved.
Thanks.
