# What I have used in this assignment?
I have used Reactjs, Javascript, React-Boilerplate, MDB(Material Design for Bootstrap), HTML, SCSS, CSS.

# How to start the app?
You can clone or download  the application from my GitHub then go inside the ‘Simple_file_sharing’ using cd Simple_file_sharing/
Install the node modules by -  npm install
Run the app using - npm start
Open your browser and type http://localhost:3000/ and press enter.

# Functionality which I have completed and How to play with App.
After typing http://localhost:3000/ in the browser you will land on the home page. On the home page, you will see a Share button for sharing the files,
Click on the share button will open a popup, you can search the users using the name or email id.

I am using temporary 10 user data, So you can search the user with the following letters like - a, b, c, m, h, k, etc

When you type the user name or email id you will see the list of suggested users, clicking on a particular user, the user will add in the member list and the user will be removed from the suggestion list

You can remove a user from member list by clicking on the cross icon button then the user will be added again in the suggestion list

Thanks.
